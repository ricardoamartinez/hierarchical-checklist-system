# 🏗️ NEW PROJECT INITIALIZATION

## 🎯 Goal
Create a clean, scalable codebase skeleton using Hybrid XaaS design: full-stack monorepo with shared backend/frontend contracts, CI/CD, and service modularity.

## 🗂 Required Execution Tree
- [ ] STEP_01__Choose_Stack_and_Framework.md
- [ ] STEP_02__Scaffold_Directory_Structure.md
- [ ] STEP_03__Initialize_Monorepo_Tooling.md
- [ ] STEP_04__Define_Service_Contracts.md
- [ ] STEP_05__Setup_CI_CD.md
- [ ] STEP_06__Register_Model_Self_Checks.md

## 🚫 Failsafe Constraints
- [ ] No file mutation unless parent checklist step is complete
- [ ] No push until structure is validated
- [ ] No commit unless structure checks pass
- [ ] On uncertain logic: write pending question to `scratchpad/model_thoughts_todo.md` and halt

## 🧠 Internal Prompt: Checklist Writer
> "Write `STEP_01__Choose_Stack_and_Framework.md` with all subgoals and verification paths. This file will link to the next file in hierarchy based on each checklist item. Each subgoal must recursively generate its own `.md` child if complex."
